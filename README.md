Incredibly basic in-browser calculator with (currently) limited functionality

Description (same as from the page) - This calculator has incredibly limited functionality,
but will eventually be added to. As it stands, the calculator does single digit addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The Positive/Negative modifier and the percent modifiers are both disabled,
as well as the decimal point. The All Clear button uses a jQuery call to refresh the page, and all division
is rounded off to 6 decimal places. Enjoy!

This simple application was used primarily for my benefit to brush up on basic html, css, and implement some jQuery as well.
I plan to come back to this and add in multiple digit functionality, as well as functionality for the currently disabled feature.
I would also like to eventually take this a step further and add in a scientific calculator version that can be swapped to, but we'll
see where I end up with this :)


HOW TO DEPLOY:
1) Download all 3 files, (.html, .js, .css)
2) Ensure that they are all within the same parent directory
3) Use a browser, such as Google Chrome, to open index.html,
4) Everything should work from here :D
